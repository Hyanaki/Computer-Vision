# Computer-Vision
Work achieved at the French University in 2017-2018.


# EigenFaces

The purpose of this work was to study the facial recognition system based on eigenfaces method developed by Sirovich et Kirby (1987).

The results are introduced in a report written in French (TP2).

# SIFT vs VGG16

The purpose of this work was to create an image research system from images.
From a given image, image descriptors are generated with SIFT and compared with a database of images. Then, the 10 most similar images from the database are returned.

Image descriptors can also be generated from neural network. Therefore, we obtained image descriptors from the famous VGG16 neural network and we achieved an image reasearch system.

The performances between the two process are compared.
The results are introduced in a report written in French ('Compte_Rendu_VO_SIFT_vs_VGG.pdf').

# Visual servoing

The purpose of this work was to get familiar with several visual servoing missions.
From the initial position of a 2D camera, the camera position converges toward the desired position.

The results are introduced in a report written in French ('TP1.pdf').
